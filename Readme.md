# Measure level with MPU6050 and arduino UNO

The file **LCD_Test_serial_float_formatting.ino** has the sketch which runs on the Arduino UNO.  
As screen the Arduino Shield - Display 2,8", Touch, 320 x 240, ILI9341 is used
The IMU MPU-6050 Accelerometer + Gyro is used to measure the level via the accelerometers 

It needs the following libraries

- TFTv2.h
    - For the LCD screen ILI9341
- MPU6050_6Axis_MotionApps20.h
